This project is a simple web-based clone of the Spotify music streaming service. It is designed using HTML and CSS to replicate the user interface and functionality of Spotify.

## Overview

This project provides a visual representation of a Spotify-like application, including a sidebar for navigation, a main content area for music recommendations, and a music player at the bottom of the page.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file is structured as follows:

- The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and includes metadata and links to external resources.
- The page is divided into a sidebar and a main content area.
- The sidebar contains navigation links, icons, and sections for creating playlists and finding podcasts.
- The main content area displays recommendations in various categories: recent plays, trending music, and best artists.
- At the bottom of the page is a music player with song information and control buttons.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides styling for the entire page.

## Responsiveness

The project is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. It includes media queries that hide or modify certain elements as the screen size changes. For example, it hides certain cards and buttons on smaller screens to maintain a clean and functional design.
